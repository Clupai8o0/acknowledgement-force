# Acknowledgement Force

**Acknowledgement, before distraction.**

A short, deliberate ritual that forces you to read your own rules before the day begins.

## What is this?

Acknowledgement Force is a productivity tool that blocks your screen at the start of each day, requiring you to read and acknowledge your personal rules before you can continue. It's designed to combat drift and avoidance by making your goals impossible to ignore.

### Why it exists

We forget goals the moment the day speeds up. Drifting and avoidance take over when rules are out of sight.

### What it does

It blocks your screen at the start of the day. It forces you to read your own rules and acknowledge them before you continue.

### What it is not

It is not motivation or productivity hacks. It is a quiet constraint that keeps you honest.

**A single screen. No escape. Until acknowledgement.**
